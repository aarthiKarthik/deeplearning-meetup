This is the repository of for the iOS app for doing real time image classification
on the device.
The Microsoft Community Meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-AI-ML-Community/)

* [15-October-2018](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-AI-ML-Community/events/254257186/):
We create an image classification model on [Custom Vision](https://customvision.ai/).
The CoreML file that was generated was used to create a real time classification iOS app.
For the demo we created Image classification model for the Lisa and Homer images from the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset).
