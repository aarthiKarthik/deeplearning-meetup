# deeplearning-meetup
This is the repository of all the code shared during the Microsoft AI Singapore
Community Meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-AI-ML-Community/)

* [17-September-2018](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-AI-ML-Community/events/254256953/): Coding Neural Networks using Keras. Jupyter Notebook was hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

* [1-October-2018](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-AI-ML-Community/events/254256953/):
Transfer Learning using Keras. We learnt how to deploy the Data Science Virtual
Machine on Azure. We also built an image classifier for the [Fruits 360 Dataset](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset).
We used transfer learning on Inception V3 and ResNet architectures to develop the
image classification model.

* [15-October-2018](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-AI-ML-Community/events/254257186/):
We create an image classification model on Custom Vision. The CoreML file that was
generated was used to create a real time classification iOS app and Android App.
